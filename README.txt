T9 Encryption - Encrypt your Text Messages or Passwords with Highly Secured Custom Algorithms instead of tradition MD5, etc.


This class offers a custom algorith that can be further
enhanced if needed.

It is great to use for passwords in database instead
of standard MD5 and other encryptions, and is hack-safe,
because normally the hackers or crackers can exploit
MD5 passwords with data dictioniries of common passwords,
but using T9 Encryption is a not so common method with
further security when salt key is used for encryption,
which nearly makes it impossible by Bots to guess
passwords.

Currently we have made it mandatory to use Salt Key
and recommend it for all encryptions you do, so that
your encrypted text is always secure.

Quickstart:
example.php - Point your webserver to the project folder
and run the example.php script. Look into example.php
file source code to see the how we called the class.

t9enc.php - This is the main T9 Encrpytion class that
is used to encrypt.
